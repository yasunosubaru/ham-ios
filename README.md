A React Native component monorepo for the Ham app, providing education-related features with over-the-air (OTA) hot update support.

## Features

- **Course Schedule** – Fetch and parse course schedules from the education system
- **Score Query** – Retrieve academic scores with structured parsing
- **Score Calculator** – GPA/weighted score calculation utilities
- **CAS Authentication** – Central Authentication Service login flow (including mobile login)
- **Hot Update** – OTA updates powered by [hot-updater](https://github.com/gronxb/hot-updater)
- **i18n** – Multi-language support (English, Chinese, Japanese)

## Tech Stack

- React Native 0.87 (New Architecture enabled)
- TypeScript
- Jotai (state management)
- i18next (internationalization)
- ESLint + Prettier (code quality)
- pnpm (package manager)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20.19 (Node 22 recommended for RN 0.87)
- pnpm 10
- Xcode (for iOS)
- Android Studio (for Android)
- CocoaPods

### Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

### iOS Setup

```bash
cd ios && pod _1.16.2_ install --no-repo-update && cd ..
```

### Running

```bash
# Start Metro bundler
pnpm start

# Run on iOS
pnpm ios

# Run on Android
pnpm android
```

### Linting

```bash
pnpm lint
```

### Testing

```bash
pnpm test
```

Runs the Jest suite with [React Native Testing Library](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/).
`pnpm test` runs `pnpm embed` first, which generates the embedded
score-calculator scripts that the tests import.

Two things to know when adding tests:

- **Every `render` / `fireEvent` / `renderHook` call must be awaited.** They
  are async in RNTL v14. Without the `await`, `render` returns an empty
  object and the global `screen` throws
  "`render` function has not been called".
- **Assert on `testID`s, not on rendered text.** User-facing strings come
  from i18next and differ across `zh` / `en` / `ja`, so text assertions
  break whenever copy changes. Components take an optional `testID` prop for
  this; see `jest.setup.ts` for the globally stubbed native modules.

```

## Standalone iOS / TestFlight

The production entry point is `index.js` (`Ham`). The former debug shell and
E2E registrations are not included in the application bundle. A standalone
build uses the separate bundle identifier `com.nowcent.ham.rn`; it does not
impersonate the official `com.nowcent.ham` record.

See [`docs/testflight.md`](./docs/testflight.md) for Apple Developer setup,
Fastlane, signing, and the manual TestFlight upload workflow. The upload
workflow requires an explicitly configured Team ID, Bundle ID, and App Store
Connect API key; those credentials are never stored in this repository.

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflows run on PRs to `main` and pushes to `main`:

- **Lint** – ESLint and TypeScript checks
- **Test** – Jest suite
- **Compile Check** – Production and debug Metro bundles for iOS and Android
- **Android Build** – Debug APK build verification
- **iOS Build** – Debug and unsigned Release simulator verification
- **iOS TestFlight Upload** – Manual signed archive and TestFlight upload
